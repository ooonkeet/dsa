You are given an n*m grid where each cell contains one character A, B, C or D.
For each cell, you must change the character to A, B, C or D. The new character must be different from the old one.
Your task is to change the characters in every cell such that no two adjacent cells have the same character.

Output
Print n lines each with m characters: the description of the final grid.
You may print any valid solution.
If no solution exists, just print IMPOSSIBLE.

Constraints
1 <= n, m <= 500
