A positive integer is taken as input in long long format. It puts the number in a loop where it runs till the number changes to 1.
It then prints the number and then puts it to ternary operation where it checks if the number is odd or even, if odd, the number is
multiplied by 3 and added one else the number is simply divided by 2. Lastly 1 is printed which completes the operation.
Time complexity - O(log n) [avg case]
Space complexity - O(1) [avg case]

Moreover this problem intersects the theory of "Collatz Conjecture" which asks whether repeating two simple arithmetic operations
will eventually transform every positive integer into 1. It concerns sequences of integers in which each term is obtained from the 
previous term as follows: if a term is even, the next term is one half of it. If a term is odd, the next term is 3 times the 
previous term plus 1. The conjecture is that these sequences always reach 1, no matter which positive integer is chosen to start 
the sequence.
