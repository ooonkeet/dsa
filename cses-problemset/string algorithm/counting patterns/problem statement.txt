Given a string and patterns, count for each pattern the number of positions where it appears in the string.
Input
The first input line has a string of length n.
The next input line has an integer k: the number of patterns. Finally, there are k lines that describe the patterns.
The string and the patterns consist of characters aâ€“z.
Output
For each pattern, print the number of positions.
Constraints

1<=n<=10^5
1<=k<=5*10^5
the total length of the patterns is at most 5*10^5

Example
Input:
aybabtu
3
