Given a tree of n nodes, your task is to count the number of distinct paths that consist of exactly k edges.

Input
The first input line contains two integers n and k: the number of nodes and the path length. The nodes are numbered 1,2,....,n.
Then there are n-1 lines describing the edges. Each line contains two integers a and b: there is an edge between nodes a and b.

Output
Print one integer: the number of paths.

Constraints
1<=k<=n<=2*10^5
1<=a,b<=n

Example
Input:
5 2
1 2
2 3
3 4
3 5

Output:
4
