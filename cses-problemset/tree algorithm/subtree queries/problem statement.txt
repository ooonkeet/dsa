You are given a rooted tree consisting of n nodes. The nodes are numbered 1,2,...,n, and node 1 is the root. Each node has a value.
Your task is to process following types of queries:
1. change the value of node s to x
2. calculate the sum of values in the subtree of node s

Input
The first input line contains two integers n and q: the number of nodes and queries. The nodes are numbered 1,2,....,n.
The next line has n integers v_1,v_2,....,v_n: the value of each node.
Then there are n-1 lines describing the edges. Each line contans two integers a and b: there is an edge between nodes a and b.
Finally, there are q lines describing the queries. Each query is either of the form "1 s x" or "2 s".

Output
Print the answer to each query of type 2.

Constraints
1<=n,q<=2*10^5
1<=a,b,s<=n
1<=v_i,x<=10^9

Example
Input:
5 3
4 2 5 2 1
1 2
1 3
