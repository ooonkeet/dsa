Given a tree of n nodes, your task is to count the number of distinct paths that have at least k_1 and at most k_2 edges.

Input
The first input line contains three integers n, k_1 and k_2: the number of nodes and the path lengths. The nodes are numbered 1,2,....,n.
Then there are n-1 lines describing the edges. Each line contains two integers a and b: there is an edge between nodes a and b.

Output
Print one integer: the number of paths.

Constraints
1<=k_1<=k_2<=n<=2*10^5
1<=a,b<=n

Example
Input:
5 2 3
1 2
2 3
3 4
3 5

Output:
6
