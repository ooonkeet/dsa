You are given a rooted tree consisting of n nodes. The nodes are numbered 1,2,...,n, and node 1 is the root. Each node has a color.
Your task is to determine for each node the number of distinct colors in the subtree of the node.

Input
The first input line contains an integer n: the number of nodes. The nodes are numbered 1,2,...,n.
The next line consists of n integers c_1,c_2,....,c_n: the color of each node.
Then there are n-1 lines describing the edges. Each line contains two integers a and b: there is an edge between nodes a and b.

Output
Print n integers: for each node 1,2,....,n, the number of distinct colors.

Constraints
1<=n<=2*10^5
1<=a,b<=n
1<=c_i<=10^9

Example
Input:
5
2 3 2 2 1
1 2
1 3
3 4
3 5

Output:
3 1 2 1 1
