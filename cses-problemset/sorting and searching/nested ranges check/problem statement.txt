Given n ranges, your task is to determine for each range if it contains some other range and if some
other range contains it.

Range [a,b] contains range [c,d] if a<=c and d<=b.

Input
The first input line has an integer n: the number of ranges.
After this, there are n lines that describe the ranges. Each line has two integers x and y: the range is [x,y].
You may assume that no range appears more than once in the input.

Output
First print a line that describes for each range (in the input order) if it contains some other range (1) or not (0).
Then print a line that describes for each range (in the input order) if some other range contains it (1) or not (0).

Constraints
1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5
1<=x<y<=10^9

Example
Input:
4
1 6
2 4
4 8
3 6

Output:
1 0 0 0
0 1 0 1
