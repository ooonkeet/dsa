Given n ranges, your task is to count for each range how many other ranges it contains and
how many other ranges contain it.
Range [a,b] contains range [c,d] if a <= c and d <= b.

Input
The first input line has an integer n: the number of ranges.
After this, there are n lines that describe the ranges. Each line has two integers x and y: the range is [x,y].
You may assume that no range appears more than once in the input.

Output
First print a line that describes for each range (in the input order) how many other ranges it contains.
Then print a line that describes for each range (in the input order) how many other ranges contain it.

Constraints
1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5
1 <= x < y <= 10^9

Example

Input:
4
1 6
2 4
4 8
3 6

Output:
2 0 0 0
0 1 0 1
