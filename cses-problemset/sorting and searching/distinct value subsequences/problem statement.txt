Given an array of n integers, count the number of subsequences where each element is distinct.
A subsequence is a sequence of array elements from left to right that may have gaps.

Input
The first line has an integer n: the array size.
The second line has n integers x_1,x_2,....,x_n: the array contents.

Output
Print the number of subsequences with distinct elements. The answer can be large, so print it modulo 10^9+7.

Constraints
1<=n<=2*10^5
1<=x_i<=10^9

Example
Input:
4
1 2 1 3

Output:
11

Explanation: The subsequences are [1] (two times), [2], [3], [1,2], [1,3] (two times),
[2,1], [2,3], [1,2,3] and [2,1,3].
