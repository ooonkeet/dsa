Given an integer array nums, return
the largest perimeter of a triangle with 
a non-zero area, formed from three of these 
lengths. If it is impossible to form any triangle
of a non-zero area, return 0.

Ex - [2,1,2]

Triangle formed - 1,2,2 {Since, 1+2>2}

Perimeter = 1+2+2 = 5

Constraints:

(1) 3 <= nums.length <= 104

(2) 1 <= nums[i] <= 106
