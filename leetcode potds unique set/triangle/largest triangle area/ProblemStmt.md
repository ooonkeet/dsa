Given an array of points on the X-Y plane points 
where points[i] = [xi, yi], return the area 
of the largest triangle that can be formed by 
any three different points. 
Answers within 10^-5 of the actual answer will be accepted.

Ex - Points are [{0,0},{0,1},{1,0},{0,2},{2,0}]

If plotted in a normal graph we can see a triangle formed of area = 2

**Constraints:**

(1) 3 <= points.length <= 50

(2) -50 <= xi, yi <= 50

(3) All the given points are unique.
