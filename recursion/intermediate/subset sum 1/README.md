Expected output = [0 1 2 3 3 4 5 6]
in sorted order.

If an array has n elements , number of subsets of the array is 2^n.

In this problem we need to take out sum of every subset arrays.
The array is = [3 1 2], therefore the subsets and their sums are as follows:

[] -> 0

[3] -> 3

[3 1] -> 4

[3 1 2] -> 6

[3 2] -> 5

[1] -> 1

[2] -> 2

[1 2] -> 3

no of elements in array = 3

âˆ´ no of subsets = 2^3 = 8.

TIME COMPLEXITY ~ O(2^n) EXPECTED

SPACE COMPLEXITY ~ O(2^n + 2^n log(2^n))
[extra space for sorting] (in fact both tc and sc would stand the same)
