This C++ Program which demonstrates the use of namespaces. 
The program creates two namespaces with a variable of same name defined in each of them but with different data type. 
The functions functionOne( ) and functionTwo( ) take an integer as an input and save in the variable “val”. 
The values of “val” are printed in the context of both namespaces.

Here is source code of the C++ program which demonstrates the use of namespaces.
